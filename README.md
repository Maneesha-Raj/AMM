# 🌟 Supply/Demand AMM (Project ongoing)

Supply/Demand AMM is a decentralized Automated Market Maker built on Ethereum. It enables seamless token swapping and liquidity provision with dynamic pricing based on supply and demand curves. This AMM allows users to swap tokens, add liquidity, and benefit from a decentralized trading mechanism.

## 📄 Project Overview
Supply/Demand AMM is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly decentralized trading experience. The platform supports liquidity providers and token traders with an adaptive pricing model driven by supply and demand.

<!-- # Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
``` -->
